2. quickSort.py
3. mergeSort.py
4. heap_sort.py
5. Analysis_MSCS532_Assignment4.docx

To simulate a run for the sorting algorithms. Run the main.py file.<br>
To change the size of the generated arrays for the sort simulation change the ***"size"*** variable value on line 81 to your liking.

Run scheduler_simulation.py and you will get a simulation of the scheduler.<br>
